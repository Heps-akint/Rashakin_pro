          Rashakin was founded in 2005 with a simple yet powerful vision: to create timeless fashion
          that empowers individuals to express their unique style.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          Our journey began in a small London atelier, where our founder, Sarah Rashakin, crafted
          her first collection of bespoke evening gowns. Today, we've grown into a global brand,
          but our commitment to quality craftsmanship and personal expression remains unchanged.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          We believe in sustainable luxury, creating pieces that are designed to last and be cherished
          for years to come. Our collections are inspired by art, architecture, and the vibrant energy
          of cities around the world.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          At Rashakin, we're more than a fashion brand - we're a community of passionate individuals
          who believe in the transformative power of style.
